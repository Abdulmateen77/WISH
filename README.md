# WISH
A fictional space transport management system developed using Object Oriented Programming in Java

In a galaxy far away, the WISH organisation manages a number of resorts offering holidays in space. 
These resorts always consist of a number of planets with different leisure facilities. Each planet is 
connected by shuttles to some of the other planets at the resort. Guests at a resort are given a 
personalised permit which must be carried when moving around the resort. Permits can be loaded with a  
number of credits. A permit must be used to make a shuttle journey to another planet and each journey 
costs a number of credits. In addition, there are a number of conditions which need to be met before 
anyone can use a permit for a shuttle journey.  Credits for permits can be bought at any time. 
This project is concerned with managing travel between planets at a resort and will initially be implemented 
at the Wayward Planets Resort (then rolled out to other resorts).
